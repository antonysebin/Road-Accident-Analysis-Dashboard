# Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard

Project Overview: Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive Power BI Dashboard that provides actionable insights into road accidents

Key Features:
Data Insights: The dashboard will offer  updates and insights into road accident statistics.
Interactive Visualizations: Users will be able to interact with the data through various visualizations, including  chartsand graphs.
Trend Analysis: Analysis of trends over time to identify patterns and recurring issues.
Statistical Exploration: Detailed statistical analysis of factors contributing to accidents, such as weather conditions, time of day, and types of vehicles involved.
Data Sources
Accident Records: Historical and real-time data on road accidents.

Methodology:
Data Collection and Integration: Gather data into a cohesive dataset.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensure data quality by cleaning and preprocessing the raw data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to uncover initial patterns and insights.
Dashboard Development: Use Power BI to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.
Validation and Testing: Validate the dashboardâ€™s accuracy and functionality through testing.

Expected Outcomes:
Enhanced Road Safety: By identifying trends and high-risk areas  we can implement measures to improve road safety.
Informed Decision-Making: Actionable insights will support data-driven decision-making.
Resource Allocation: Better allocation of resources for road safety initiatives based on data-driven insights.
